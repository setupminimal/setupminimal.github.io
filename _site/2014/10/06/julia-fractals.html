<p>One of the projects that Iâ€™m working on right now involves a lot of Julia Fractals, and so I thought I would lay out a bit of what they are and explain some interesting things about them.</p>

<p>Julia Fractals are a mathematical concept based on the idea of infinity-fold recursion of functions. The points in a Julia Set are the points where a function iterated an infinite number of times will not reach infinity. This is one of those things that seems simple and kinda boring, until you see what some of them look like.</p>

<p>I will probably figure out how to insert images into these sometime in the next week.</p>
