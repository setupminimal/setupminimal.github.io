    <root><h1>Digital Humanities Tools</h1><br/><br/>The <a href="https://github.com/setupminimal/digital-humanities-tools">Digital Humanities Toolkit</a> is a small set of utilities I put together to help my mother, <a href="https://wordsthatyouweresaying.wordpress.com">Sparrow F. Alden</a>, with her project in which she constructed a digital concordance of The Hobbit. The tools
are available for free, and all you need to run them is <a href="https://python.org">Python</a>, so if you find yourself needing to write a concordance of a large body of text, your day might have just gotten a lot easier.
