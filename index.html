    <h2>Things Available on the Web:</h2>
    <h3>
      <a href="https://setupminimal.github.io/blog/">Integral Morphology</a>
    </h3>
    <p>My blog. A hopefully entertaining collection of weekly lessons learned.</p>
    <h3>
      <a href="https://setupminimal.github.io/FoxyName.html">Secret Foxy Society Name Generator</a>
    </h3>
    <p>The Secret Foxy Society Name Generator will give you an Official Secret Foxy Society Name, should you be lacking one.
    Or even if you have one already.<br/>
    <a href="https://setupminimal.github.io/FoxyName.html">Find it here.</a></p>
    <h3>
      <a href="https://setupminimal.github.io/paperclip-optimizer/game.html">Paperclip Optimizer: The Paperclip Maximization Game.</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Paperclip Optimizer is a game about making paperclips. With a real simulated economy, many tools to enable paperclip production, and a charming green color-scheme, I'm honestly surprized that this game hasn't been nominated for any awards.</p>
    <h2>Software Which I Have Written, but Which is not Polished:</h2>
    <h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/setupminimal/cambast">Cambast</a>
    </h3>
    <p>A cambast is a money lender. This project is a piece of scheduling software, based on the idea that every task has a certain value. It was inspired by "The Cambast and Lord Iron", a very good short story.</p>
    <h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/setupminimal/PyJulia">Julia Clock</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Julia Clock is an experiment in beautiful time. It takes the current time and generates a unique image of a Julia Set, the colors, symmetries, position, rotation, size, and texture of which are all indications of different aspects of the time. Try watching it for a while, and see what you find! </p>
