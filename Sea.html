<p>"Charles," I said, "this doesn't look right."</p>
<p>c-He just grunted, before setting down c-his work and trudging to the edge of the boat.</p>
<p>"Yup." He replied, "That's a very surprising island for our supposed location."</p>
<p>"... It's not a sea monster, is it?" I queried fearfully.</p>
<p>Charles seemed to consider this for a moment, before patting me on the shoulder and stating "Nah. I reckon whatever they did to all the dragons will have taken out the leviathans too. Maybe that's the problem."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Well, they say all the dragons just fell from the skies when the mages did their great binding. But what do dead things do at sea?"</p>
<p>Oh. They floated, of course. Now I felt silly for having asked.</p>
<p>And that did explain the smell of dead fish that was beginning to spread out across the waves.</p></div>
