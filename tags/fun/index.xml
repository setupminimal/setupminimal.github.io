      <description>Here is a fun little art project I made this morning!
I thought to myself &amp;ldquo;Self, what if we made a little program that would try to make &amp;lsquo;watercolor-y&amp;rsquo; images by starting with a random canvas, and smudging the paint around?&amp;rdquo;
So I coded it up, and it looked cool, but not that cool:
 Then I thought &amp;ldquo;What if we made it so that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just poking the canvas randomly, but actually trying to match another image?</description>

      <description>I created the Foxy Society Name Generator a while ago for the HPKCHC. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun way to find out what your Secret Foxy Society Name might be.</description>

      <description>Paperclip Optimizer is a fun little game that I made with Clojurescript. In it, you play an AI who&amp;rsquo;s goal is to maximize the number of paperclips in the world - the number of paperclips is essentially your score. But! Your job isn&amp;rsquo;t as simple as just producing as many paperclips as possible through manual labor - the world of Paperclip Optimizer has a full-fledged economy, that you need to exploit if you want to produce the most paperclips.</description>
