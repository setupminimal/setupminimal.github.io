      <description>Here is a fun little art project I made this morning!
I thought to myself &amp;ldquo;Self, what if we made a little program that would try to make &amp;lsquo;watercolor-y&amp;rsquo; images by starting with a random canvas, and smudging the paint around?&amp;rdquo;
So I coded it up, and it looked cool, but not that cool:
 Then I thought &amp;ldquo;What if we made it so that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just poking the canvas randomly, but actually trying to match another image?</description>

      <description>The Digital Humanities Toolkit is a small set of utilities I put together to help my mother, Sparrow F. Alden, with her project in which she constructed a digital concordance of The Hobbit. The tools are available for free, and all you need to run them is Python, so if you find yourself needing to write a concordance of a large body of text, your day might have just gotten a lot easier.</description>
