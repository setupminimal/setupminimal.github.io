      <description>Paperclip Optimizer is a fun little game that I made with Clojurescript. In it, you play an AI who&amp;rsquo;s goal is to maximize the number of paperclips in the world - the number of paperclips is essentially your score. But! Your job isn&amp;rsquo;t as simple as just producing as many paperclips as possible through manual labor - the world of Paperclip Optimizer has a full-fledged economy, that you need to exploit if you want to produce the most paperclips.</description>
