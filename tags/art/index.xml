      <description>Here is a fun little art project I made this morning!
I thought to myself &amp;ldquo;Self, what if we made a little program that would try to make &amp;lsquo;watercolor-y&amp;rsquo; images by starting with a random canvas, and smudging the paint around?&amp;rdquo;
So I coded it up, and it looked cool, but not that cool:
 Then I thought &amp;ldquo;What if we made it so that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just poking the canvas randomly, but actually trying to match another image?</description>

      <description>I created JuliaClock during High School for my required art credit. JuliaClock is a program that takes the current time, generates a unique Julia Set, and then simulates painting it.
If you are interested in the Source Code, you may be able to get JuliaClock to run on your computer. It relies on the Python Image Library and on TK. If you&amp;rsquo;d rather just look at pretty pictures: (and videos, at the bottom)</description>
