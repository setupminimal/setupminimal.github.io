[Paperclip Optimizer](https://setupminimal.github.io/paperclip-optimizer/game.html) is a fun little game that I made with [Clojurescript](https://clojurescript.org). In it, you play an AI who's goal is to maximize the number of paperclips in the world - the number of paperclips is essentially your score. *But!* Your job isn't as simple as just producing as many paperclips as possible through manual labor - the world of Paperclip Optimizer has a full-fledged economy, that you need to exploit if you want to produce the most paperclips. (Which you should.)
