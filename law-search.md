[Law Search](https://setupminimal.github.io/law-search/lawSearch.html) is a tool that I made a little while ago. It is still a bit rough around the edges, but it allows you to search [OpenStates.org](https://openstates.org) data for bills with certain keywords. It was also the first thing that I built with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org).
