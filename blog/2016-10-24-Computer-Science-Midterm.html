    <root><h1 id="computer-science-midterm">Computer Science Midterm</h1><p>Guess what!</p><p>Surprising Midterm!</p><p>Quick! What is the time complexity of this algorithm, and what is it called?:</p><hr/><p>def mystery(a_list):  for i in range(len(a_list)):  for j in range(1, i):  if a_list[j&ndash;1] &gt; a_list[j]:  a_list[j&ndash;1], a_list[j] = a_list[j], a_list[j&ndash;1]  return a_list &mdash;-</p><p>Answer: This algorithm is <code>O(n^2)</code> with respect to the length of <code>a_list</code>, and it&rsquo;s called bubble sort.</p><p>Explanation: Since the algorithm seems to resolve around that comparison in the center, we can make a formula showing how many times that comparison happens. <code>T(n) = n(n - 1)/2</code> happens to be that formula. Why? Because the outer loop goes <code>n</code> times, and the inner loop goes <code>(n - 1)/2</code> times on average. If we multiply everything out, we get <code>T(n) = 1/2n^2 - 1/2n</code>, which is on the order of <code>n^2</code>, so the complexity is <code>O(n^2)</code>. As for how to remember it&rsquo;s name, the algorithm goes through the list a bunch, and swaps adjacent items. That&rsquo;s what the longest line is doing. This makes items kind of &lsquo;bubble&rsquo; to the top of the list.</p><p>Next! What is a doubly-linked list?</p><p>Answer: It&rsquo;s a list where each &lsquo;cell&rsquo; of the list contains pointers to the next item, and to the previous item, making it possible to traverse the list in both directions.</p><p>Finally! Why is this post written in such a staccato style?</p><p>Answer: It matches the way my midterm was structured, and it&rsquo;s actually really fun to write rapid-fire responses to myself.</p><p>Postscript! Was that all that was covered on the midterm?</p><p>Answer: No! We were also asked to step through different sorting algorithms, but I don&rsquo;t want to torture my readers with that.</p><p>I hope to see you all next week, for another death-defying computer science class!</p></root>
