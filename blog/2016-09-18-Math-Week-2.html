    <root><h1 id="math-week-2">Math Week 2</h1><p>In an unexpected and thrilling departure from the syllabus and our expectations, this week Math Proofs, our exciting new math course, covered Boolean logic.</p><h3 id="statements">Statements</h3><p>In math, especially abstract math, it&rsquo;s fun to categorize things that one would usually take for granted. For example, the previous sentence is an example of a statement. A statement is a thing that is either true or false. In logic, you can combine statements to form compound statements the truth value of which depends on the constituent statements. I.E. <code>It is raining and I am in France</code> depends on <code>It is raining</code> and <code>I am in France</code>.</p><p>Here are the ways we talked about to combine statements:</p><ul><li>And</li><li>Or</li><li>Not</li><li>Implies (-&gt;)</li><li>The Bi-conditional ()</li></ul><p><code>And</code> and <code>or</code> seem pretty straight forward. <code>Not</code> is also simple (It makes <code>I am in France</code> into <code>I am _not_ in France</code>). But let&rsquo;s use the idea of <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code> to demonstrate how truth tables work: (T is for True and F is for False)</p><hr/><p>P | Q | P and Q | P or Q | not P &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; T | T | T | T | F T | F | F | T | F F | T | F | T | T F | F | F | F | T &mdash;-</p><p>The idea here is pretty simple. The table shows all the possible values of <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code>, which are statements, along with the result of using <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>. If you don&rsquo;t quite get it, go through the table and assure yourself that everything in the <code>P and Q</code> column matches your intuition of what <code>P and Q</code> should be.</p><p>This gives us a good way to demonstrate how implication and the bi-conditional work:</p><hr/><p>P | Q | P -&gt; Q | P  Q &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; T | T | T | T T | F | F | F F | T | T | F F | F | T | T &mdash;-</p><p>Implication is true, except when <code>P</code> is true and <code>Q</code> is false. This is because either <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code> are both true, and so <code>P implies Q</code> makes sense, or <code>P</code> is false, and so no matter what <code>Q</code> is, the problem is with <code>P</code>, and not your logic. My professor says this can be a bit difficult to grasp, so you might want to meditate on implication for a moment.</p><p>The bi-conditional is even easier. Either both <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code> are true, or they&rsquo;re both false. Their fates are bound together.</p><h3 id="open-sentences">Open Sentences</h3><p>There&rsquo;s only one thing left that we have yet to cover from last week, which is open sentences. An open sentence is like a statement with a variable, with a few rules. You have to say what that variable can be, and if you put the variable in the sentence, it must either be true or false.</p><p>Example!</p><hr/><p>P(f) : I am in f. where f is in {France, Belgium, Taiwan, Trouble}. &mdash;-</p><p><code>P(f)</code> is an open sentence, because if you substitute any of those things in place of f, you have a statement. That&rsquo;s all we really covered with open sentences, but I&rsquo;m told they&rsquo;re important, so hold onto that knowledge.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll be back again next week, folks, but I&rsquo;m not sure where the syllabus will take us.</p></root>
