    <root><h1 id="trees">Trees!</h1><p>I really like trees. Both the growing kind, and the computer science kind. Remember Linked Lists? A bunch of cells strung together to form a chain, where each cell has a pointer to the next cell? Trees are almost the same idea.</p><p>Picture this: A cell with a &lsquo;left&rsquo; pointer and a &lsquo;right&rsquo; pointer. Instead of just being able to follow along the chain, the chain branches. This makes a structure like this:</p><hr/><pre><code>4</code></pre><p> / 
 11 2  /   
7 5 9 &mdash;-</p><p>Some terminology: Each number is a node. The height of the tree is how deep it is (3). The root of the tree is the topmost node (4). The ones on the bottom are called leaves.</p><p>What is this useful for? Actually, a lot of things. For example, file-systems are trees. There&rsquo;s a root directory (<code>/</code> or <code>C:\</code>), and descending from the root, there&rsquo;s a system of other directories, and files. Trees are also used for storing data that needs to be ordered, or that depends on other data.</p><p>One common use for trees is representing mathematical expressions.</p><hr/><pre><code>+</code></pre><h2 id="-----------3-5-9"> / 
 * 
 /   
3 5 9</h2><p>This represents <code>9 + 3*5</code>. Pure mathematical expressions aren&rsquo;t the only thing that can be represented, though. Take, for example:</p><hr/><p> define  / 
 fact *  / / 
n n fact  
 -  / 
 n 1 &mdash;-</p><p>This represents a piece of code:</p><hr/><p>def fact(n):  return n * fact(n &ndash; 1) &mdash;-</p><p><em>Note: This code doesn&rsquo;t work and runs forever. To make it terminate, you would need to include a condition that <code>fact(0) = 1</code></em></p><p>These kinds of trees are called Expression trees or Abstract Syntax Trees. They&rsquo;re the most common way for compilers and other programs that deal with source code to represent programs internally. Representing programs like this makes them simple to execute: evaluate the left, the right, and then do what the node says.</p><p>There are other uses of trees - binary search trees, hash trees, etc. - but that&rsquo;s the overview. See you again next week!</p></root>
