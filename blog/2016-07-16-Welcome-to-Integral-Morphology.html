    <p>Hello! I&#8217;m <a href="mailto:setupminimal@gmail.com">Setupminimal</a> (Daroc Alden), an incoming freshman at the University of New Hampshire. I enjoy writing software (Check out <a href="https://setupminimal.github.io/paperclip-optimizer/game.html">Paperclip Optimizer: The Paperclip Maximization Game</a>), constructed languages, and <em>really</em> long term planning.</p>

    <p>I also, perhaps more than anything, enjoy learning. Because of this, I intend to post weekly about things I&#8217;ve learned, either working on my personal projects, working at the <a href="https://iol.unh.eud">UNH-IOL</a>, or, once class starts, as a Computer Science student at UNH. Doing this not only helps me keep track of what I&#8217;ve learned, and helps make it stick, but hopefully provides you with something interesting to read and enjoy.</p>

    <p>So thank you, and I&#8217;ll see you next week.</p>
