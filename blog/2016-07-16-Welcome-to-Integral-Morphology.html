    <root><h1 id="welcome-to-integral-morphology">Welcome to Integral Morphology</h1><p>Hello! I&rsquo;m link:mailto:setupminimal@gmail.com[Setupminimal] (Daroc Alden), an incoming freshman at the University of New Hampshire. I enjoy writing software (Check out link:https://setupminimal.github.io/paperclip-optimizer/game.html[Paperclip Optimizer: The Paperclip Maximization Game]), constructed languages, and <em>really</em> long term planning.</p><p>I also, perhaps more than anything, enjoy learning. Because of this, I intend to post weekly about things I&rsquo;ve learned, either working on my personal projects, working at the link:https://iol.unh.eud[UNH-IOL], or, once class starts, as a Computer Science student at UNH. Doing this not only helps me keep track of what I&rsquo;ve learned, and helps make it stick, but hopefully provides you with something interesting to read and enjoy.</p><p>So thank you, and I&rsquo;ll see you next week.</p></root>
