    <root><h1 id="graphs">Graphs</h1><p>This week in Computer Science, we talked about graphs. Remember linked lists and trees? They both had a common structure, which looks a bit like this:</p><hr/><p>+&mdash;&mdash;-+ | value | +&mdash;&mdash;-+ | next/ | | prev/ | | left/ | | right | +&mdash;&mdash;-+ &mdash;-</p><p>That is, a value, and then a bunch of pointers showing where to go next. Both linked lists and trees are special cases of a structure called a <em>graph</em>. A graph doesn&rsquo;t put any constraints on the number of other nodes a node can point to. In general, graphs don&rsquo;t even require that all the nodes be pointed to by something. A graph is just a collection of nodes, and the edges that connect them.</p><p>These turn out to be useful for many things. Graphs can be used to represent:</p><ul><li>Maps (I.E. roadmaps, or video-game levels)</li><li>Regular Expressions (with labeled edges)</li><li>Schedules (edges represent conflicts)</li><li>Mazes</li><li>Social Networks</li><li>Many, Many Other Things</li></ul><p>Since graphs have such variety, there are some vocabulary terms used to describe different types of graph:</p><p> . Connected Graph  - You can get from one node to every other node. No nodes are left all by their lonesome.  . Directed Graph  - These graphs have pointers only in one direction.  . Undirected Graph  - Edges go both ways.  . Acyclic Graph  - The graph is arranged in such a way that you can&rsquo;t end up going around in circles - these graphs usually look like trees.  . Cyclic Graph  - A graph where you <em>can</em> go around in circles.  . Planar Graph  - A graph that can be drawn on paper, without the edges crossing.</p><p>Okay, so once you have a graph, what can you do with it?</p><h3 id="search">Search</h3><p>Say that you have a graph representing a roadmap - the nodes are towns, and the edges are roads between them. If I want to find the shortest path between two towns, I can use one of the many graph searching algorithms to find the path. So far, we&rsquo;ve only covered depth-first and breadth-first search in class, neither of which is guaranteed to give the shortest path, but they will give you <em>a</em> path, so that&rsquo;s something.</p><p>Depth first and breadth first search both work in the same way:</p><ol><li>Start at a node</li><li>Mark this node as visited</li><li>Add this node&rsquo;s unvisited neighbors to your list of things to visit</li></ol><p>and then depth first search says:</p><ul><li>Now go to the last place you wrote down, and repeat.</li></ul><p>where breadth first search says:</p><ul><li>Now go to the first place you wrote down, and repeat.</li></ul><p>This results in depth-first search going off down a long path first, whereas breadth-first search uses a longer list, but searches one area completely before moving to the next area.</p><p>So what else can we do with graphs?</p><h3 id="coloring">Coloring</h3><p>Let&rsquo;s say that you have a graph representing a schedule. Nodes are events, and edges connect nodes that can&rsquo;t happen in the same time slot. Now mark the first node with a time. Now go through the nodes, and give each one the earliest time that one of their neighbors doesn&rsquo;t already have. Amazing! You now have a schedule for all of your events.</p><p>Graph coloring can also be used to, e.g., pick colors for a map so that no two adjacent countries share a color. Or you can use graph coloring to find clusters in a scatter-plot. Or to determine if a graph is planar.</p><p>Graphs are pretty cool. I believe that we will still be talking about them next week. Check in then for more graph-related fun!</p></root>
