    <root><h1 id="the-start-of-a-new-term">The Start of a New Term</h1><p>Hello everyone! I&rsquo;m back, after a long (and remarkably busy) winter break!</p><p>Here are the courses I will be taking this year:</p><h3 id="cs-515---data-structures">CS 515 - Data Structures</h3><p>I&rsquo;m excited for this course. In it, we will be learning about C++, memory layout and cache optimization, and different generally-useful data structures (2&ndash;3 Trees, etc.).</p><p>This first week footnote:[Only 3 days long, because of unfortunate weather], we talked about Abstract Data Types, and how things are actually represented on computers. This is similar to things that I covered in my articles on CS 417 last year - I used a lot of ASCII-art diagrams to show people the structure of individual objects in memory.</p><h3 id="cs-520---assembly-language">CS 520 - Assembly Language</h3><p>This course looks hard, but rewarding. In it, we are going to use plain C, instead of C++, and connect the gaps between our current understanding of computers at a high-level, and an Electrical Engineer&rsquo;s understanding of the actual circuitry and chip design.</p><p>Our first lesson laid out the Professor&rsquo;s expectations for the course, as well as giving a short listing of what we will be creating.</p><h3 id="introduction-to-theater">Introduction to Theater</h3><p>The professor for this course is very &hellip; footnote:[Observe the dramatic pause] dramatic. This course combines History, Literary Criticism, and Acting to introduce students to live theater. The professor insists that proper Theater (you can hear the capital letters when she speaks) can&rsquo;t be taught out of books - so I may not have much success is relaying this particular class for your reading pleasure.</p><h3 id="hist-440d---citizens-and-persons">HIST 440D - Citizens and Persons</h3><p>This year UNH is hosting a series of lectures called &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Human Now?&rdquo;, a look at persecution, dehumanization, civil rights, and science through history. Several professors are collaborating to run the HIST 440 courses (sections A-D), as a way to get more in-depth perspective on citizenship and person hood from students in many majors.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t really know exactly what to expect, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to it just the same.</p><h3 id="and-an-extra">And An Extra</h3><p>I am also setting aside time - as promised on my Patreon page - to do research into statistics detailing different sections of the population during the Revolutionary War. My very generous supporters want one large summary once all of my research is finished, so I won&rsquo;t have weekly updates.</p><h2 id="a-final-note">A Final Note</h2><p>One last thing. I am taking what are generally regarded as the two toughest non-elective undergraduate CS courses, as well as Honors history, in addition to my own research, writing, and programming footnote:[I actually just finished a helpful little web app that allows you to look up laws and bills - link:https://setupminimal.github.io/lawSearch.html[find it here.]].</p><p>So I&rsquo;m going to apologies in advance for missing updates. This blog is one way that I revise and push my understanding of the subjects I study, but actual assignments, as well as my job at the UNH InterOperability Laboratory, take time.</p><p>That said, I am genuinely pleased to have so many people interested in reading about my studies, and I appreciate your support quite a lot. I look forward to telling you next week about my first programming assignments (Unicode conversion), and my reading for History (from <em>Inventing Human Rights</em> and <em>No Constitutional Right to be Ladies</em>).</p></root>
