    <p>Hello everyone! I&#8217;m back, after a long (and remarkably busy) winter break!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Here are the courses I will be taking this year:</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="sect2">
    <h3 id="_cs_515_data_structures">CS 515 - Data Structures</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I&#8217;m excited for this course. In it, we will be learning about C++, memory layout and cache optimization, and different generally-useful data structures (2-3 Trees, etc.).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>This first week <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>, we talked about Abstract Data Types, and how things are actually represented on computers. This is similar to things that I covered in my articles on CS 417 last year - I used a lot of ASCII-art diagrams to show people the structure of individual objects in memory.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="sect2">
    <h3 id="_cs_520_assembly_language">CS 520 - Assembly Language</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>This course looks hard, but rewarding. In it, we are going to use plain C, instead of C++, and connect the gaps between our current understanding of computers at a high-level, and an Electrical Engineer&#8217;s understanding of the actual circuitry and chip design.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Our first lesson laid out the Professor&#8217;s expectations for the course, as well as giving a short listing of what we will be creating.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="sect2">
    <h3 id="_introduction_to_theater">Introduction to Theater</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The professor for this course is very &#8230;&#8203; <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup> dramatic. This course combines History, Literary Criticism, and Acting to introduce students to live theater. The professor insists that proper Theater (you can hear the capital letters when she speaks) can&#8217;t be taught out of books - so I may not have much success is relaying this particular class for your reading pleasure.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="sect2">
    <h3 id="_hist_440d_citizens_and_persons">HIST 440D - Citizens and Persons</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>This year UNH is hosting a series of lectures called "Who&#8217;s Human Now?", a look at persecution, dehumanization, civil rights, and science through history. Several professors are collaborating to run the HIST 440 courses (sections A-D), as a way to get more in-depth perspective on citizenship and person hood from students in many majors.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I don&#8217;t really know exactly what to expect, but I&#8217;m looking forward to it just the same.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="sect2">
    <h3 id="_and_an_extra">And An Extra</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>I am also setting aside time - as promised on my Patreon page - to do research into statistics detailing different sections of the population during the Revolutionary War. My very generous supporters want one large summary once all of my research is finished, so I won&#8217;t have weekly updates.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="sect1">
    <h2 id="_a_final_note">A Final Note</h2>
    <div class="sectionbody">
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>One last thing. I am taking what are generally regarded as the two toughest non-elective undergraduate CS courses, as well as Honors history, in addition to my own research, writing, and programming <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>So I&#8217;m going to apologies in advance for missing updates. This blog is one way that I revise and push my understanding of the subjects I study, but actual assignments, as well as my job at the UNH InterOperability Laboratory, take time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>That said, I am genuinely pleased to have so many people interested in reading about my studies, and I appreciate your support quite a lot. I look forward to telling you next week about my first programming assignments (Unicode conversion), and my reading for History (from <em>Inventing Human Rights</em> and <em>No Constitutional Right to be Ladies</em>).</p>
