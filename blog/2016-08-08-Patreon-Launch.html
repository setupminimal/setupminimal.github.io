    <root><h1 id="patreon-launch">Patreon Launch</h1><p>I have wonderful news this week! I just launched my link:https://patreon.com/daroc[Patreon]!</p><h2 id="whats-this">What&rsquo;s this?</h2><p>As you probably know, I&rsquo;m looking to start Computer Science at the University of New Hampshire in the fall - this is my way of helping to pay for it. I hope that enough people will find my writing here useful that I become self-funding. That&rsquo;s a far off goal, so I&rsquo;m going to start with one much closer: $26 a month, less than Bernie Sanders much touted average donation, which will pay for a single day of classes every month - with help from scholarships, student loans, and my family.</p><p>(If we make it to $40 a month, I will be making ~$8/hr. for working on this blog. I bet you can do it.)</p><h2 id="what-i-give-to-you">What I Give to You</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t believe in free lunches, so I want to explicitly spell out what I&rsquo;m going to be providing to you, in return for your support.</p><p>Weekly summeries of each of the following classes: <code>- Honors Bionics 444 - An introduction to the intersection of Biology and Electrical Engineering.
- Computer Science 417: From Programs to Computer Science - An introduction to what Computer Science is.
- Intro to Electrical Engineering - Circuts, magnetic and electric fields, and probably stories about electrocuting myself.
- Intro to Information Technology - What Information Technology is, how the internet works, and what it means for You.</code></p><p>If I make it to $179/month (or $100 from an individual doner) I will also provide summeries of topics of your choice - whatever that may turn out to be.</p><p><em>Plus</em> the origional and personal researches and interests that I already include in my blog. They may become less frequent once term begins, though.</p><p>So, Huzzah! I&rsquo;ll see you all again soon with more entertaining lessons.</p><h2 id="and">And,</h2><p>Thanks.</p></root>
