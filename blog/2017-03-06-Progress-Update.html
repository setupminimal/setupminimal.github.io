    <p>Remember how I will do research projects of your choice if you meet a certain target on <a href="https://patreon.com/daroc">my Patreon</a>? The project that I am currently working on <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> is nowhere near done, but I thought I would share a few things from my research so far.</p>

    <h3 id="_the_first_us_census">The First US Census</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The first US Census was conducted in 1790, and the results are still available electronically from the US government. They didn&#8217;t ask any of the modern questions we might expect about income, ethnicity, profession, etc. Instead, they asked each head of house the following:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ulist">
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>How many White males are there in your family above 16?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>How many White males below 16?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>How many White females?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>How many other free persons?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>How many slaves?</p>

    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>That was it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Not very useful from a historical point of view - although it does allow one to crunch the numbers and work out population density (very low) and rates of urbanization (also very low).</p>

    <div class="sect2">
    <h3 id="_what_about_other_historical_databases">What about other historical databases?</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Cambridge has a lovely "Historical Statistics of the United States" that gives all sorts of historical figures about population - but only after 1790. And they didn&#8217;t add categories other than the above until later. So their earliest data is clearly cribbed from the census, while their later data is brought in from a large variety of sources.</p>

    <h3 id="_okay_so_who_does_have_historical_records">Okay, so who does have historical records?</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Well, my history professor recommended looking into military and parish records. This seems like a good idea, until you realize how many of those there are, and how almost none of them have actually been indexed. And then you continue to look for actual records (by going to speak with your university&#8217;s library&#8217;s special collections department), and you ask your history professor for the names of some people to speak with. And then you wait to hear back from them. And you still don&#8217;t have any historical records.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>True! I have several book recommendations, which I am slowly working my way through. The first is "Age of Homespun: Objects and Stories in the Creation of an American Myth" by Laurel Thatcher Ulrich <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>, which is relevant to my research only in that it&#8217;s a social history of the correct time period, but has been interesting-ish so far.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>The other recommendation I got was a novel by Alex Meyers, a professor at Philips Exiter, that I haven&#8217;t tracked down yet.</p>
