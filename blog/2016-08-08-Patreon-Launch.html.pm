<p>I have wonderful news this week! I just launched my <a href="https://patreon.com/daroc">Patreon</a>!</p>

<h2 id="_whats_this">What&#8217;s this?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you probably know, I&#8217;m looking to start Computer Science at the University of New Hampshire in the fall - this is my way of helping to pay for it. I hope that enough people will find my writing here useful that I become self-funding. That&#8217;s a far off goal, so I&#8217;m going to start with one much closer: $26 a month, less than Bernie Sanders much touted average donation, which will pay for a single day of classes every month - with help from scholarships, student loans, and my family.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(If we make it to $40 a month, I will be making ~$8/hr. for working on this blog. I bet you can do it.)</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I don&#8217;t believe in free lunches, so I want to explicitly spell out what I&#8217;m going to be providing to you, in return for your support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Weekly summeries of each of the following classes:
<code><code>`
- Honors Bionics 444 - An introduction to the intersection of Biology and Electrical Engineering.
- Computer Science 417: From Programs to Computer Science - An introduction to what Computer Science is.
- Intro to Electrical Engineering - Circuts, magnetic and electric fields, and probably stories about electrocuting myself.
- Intro to Information Technology - What Information Technology is, how the internet works, and what it means for You.
</code>`</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If I make it to $179/month (or $100 from an individual doner) I will also provide summeries of topics of your choice - whatever that may turn out to be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Plus</em> the origional and personal researches and interests that I already include in my blog. They may become less frequent once term begins, though.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, Huzzah! I&#8217;ll see you all again soon with more entertaining lessons.</p>
