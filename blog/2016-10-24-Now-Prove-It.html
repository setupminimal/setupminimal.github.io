    <root><h1 id="now-prove-it">Now Prove It!</h1><p>This week we reviewed our proof techniques by showing some interesting things about the triangle inequality, sets, and DeMorgan&rsquo;s law.</p><h3 id="the-triangle-inequality">The Triangle Inequality</h3><p>The triangle inequality states that for real numbers <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, <code>|x + y| ≤ |x| + |y|</code>. We can prove this by looking at a few cases: footnote:[I&rsquo;m not going to structure it like a formal proof, because, quite frankly, I&rsquo;m tired of them and I don&rsquo;t think it helps you to understand what&rsquo;s going on.]</p><ul><li>If both x and y are positive, then <code>x + y = |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y| = x + y</code>, which you can see is true because <code>x + y ≤ x + y</code>.</li><li>If x is positive and y is negative, then <code>|x + y| ≤ |x| + |y|</code> because <code>|x + y| ≤ x</code>.</li><li>If x is negative and y is positive, the same logic applies.</li><li>If both x and y are negative, then <code>-x - y = |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y| = -x - y</code> because <code>-x - y = -x - y</code>.</li></ul><p>Why is it called the <em>triangle</em> inequality? Because this can also be shows using triangles. <code>|x|</code> is the length of one side, <code>|y|</code> of the other, and <code>|x + y|</code> is the length of the hypotenuse. Clearly, if all of the edges of the triangle are to connect, this equality must hold true. footnote:[Yes, this means that the triangle inequality was derived using vector math, but since <code>≤</code> isn&rsquo;t well defined for vectors, it&rsquo;s expressed in terms of their lengths.] This doesn&rsquo;t seem super exciting, but it turns out to show up a lot when proving other things, so I wanted to mention it so that the tool would be in your head, to mix a metaphor.</p><h3 id="demorgans-law">DeMorgan&rsquo;s Law</h3><p>The other really amazing part of this week was actually something my professor just mentioned offhand. First, some background. If you have a logical statement (remember those) <code>not (P and Q)</code>, that&rsquo;s equivalent to <code>not P or not Q</code>. That&rsquo;s DeMorgan&rsquo;s law, as it applies to logic. Also remember that sets have a <em>complement</em>, that is, the set of all things not in the first set. Okay. Now comes the mind-shaking part that my professor wrote on the board. <code>The complement of (A intersection B) = The complement of A union the complement of B</code>. footnote:[He used actual symbols, of course, but I heard from some people that the union and intersection symbols weren&rsquo;t showing up for them. I&rsquo;m working on it.] Then, the professor called that DeMorgan&rsquo;s law.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>This one law applies to both sets and logic? If you look at the two examples, those seem similar. Replace <code>not</code> with <code>complement</code>, <code>or</code> with <code>union</code> and <code>and</code> with <code>intersection</code>. Does this reveal a deeper symmetry&rsquo;s between logic and set theory? Maybe! I&rsquo;m not yet sufficiently knowledgeable, so I don&rsquo;t know why this similarity occurs or how to prove it, although I have some ideas involving looking at membership of statements in sets &hellip;</p><p>Regardless, it was an exiting realization. I hope you join me next week for another bout of math!</p></root>
