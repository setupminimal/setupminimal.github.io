    <p>This week in math we talked about some basic proof strategies, all based around proving implications.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="_direct_proof">Direct Proof</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>This one is the most straight forward. If you are trying to prove that <code>P &#8594; Q</code>, you can use a direct proof by assuming <code>P</code> and deriving <code>Q</code>. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
    <pre>We will use a direct proof to prove that if x is odd, x + 3 is even.
    Assume x is odd. This means that x = 2*k + 1, for some integer k.
    Therefore, x + 3 = 2*k + 1 + 3 = 2*k + 4 = 2 * (k + 2). Since
    k + 2 is an integer, we know that 2 * (k + 2) must be an even integer.
    Therefore, if x is odd, x + 3 is even. Q.E.D.</pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Hooray! That wasn&#8217;t too complicated.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="sect2">
    <h3 id="_trivial_proof">Trivial Proof</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Another method is to simply ignore <code>P</code> and prove that <code>Q</code> is always true, so <code>P &#8594; Q</code> is true whether or not <code>P</code> is true. This is a trivial proof. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
    <pre>We will use a trivial proof to prove that if it is Sunday,
    x^2 + 4x + 5 != 0. Since x^2 + 4x + 5 = x^2 + 4x + 4 + 1 =
    (x + 2)^2 + 1, and (x + 2)^2 is greater than or equal to zero,
    (x + 2)^2 + 1 &gt;= 0 + 1 &gt; 0. So x^2 + 4x + 5 != 0. Q.E.D.</pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="sect2">
    <h3 id="_vacuous_proof">Vacuous Proof</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Instead of ignoring <code>P</code>, you can also choose to ignore <code>Q</code>. Remember that <code>P &#8594; Q</code> is true when <code>P</code> is false - regardless of <code>Q</code>. So if we can prove that <code>P</code> is false, we have proven <code>P &#8594; Q</code>. Example time:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
    <pre>We will use a vacuous proof to prove that when |sin(x)| &lt; -(x^2),
    I am wearing blue socks. Since |sin(x)| &gt;= 0, and -(x^2) &lt;= 0,
    |sin(x)| can never be less than -(x^2), so the statement is proven.
    Q.E.D.</pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="sect2">
    <h3 id="_contrapositive_proof">Contrapositive Proof</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Finally, if we want to prove that <code>P &#8594; Q</code>, we can prove that <code>not Q &#8594; not P</code> instead. Those two statements are logically equivalent, because <code>(not (P &#8594; Q)) = (P and not Q) = (not Q and not (not P)) = (not Q and P) = (not (not Q &#8594; not P))</code>. So this is like a direct proof - assume <code>not Q</code>, and prove <code>not P</code>. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="listingblock">
    <div class="content">
    <pre>We will use a Contrapositive proof to prove that if x &gt; 3, then
    x^2 - 4x + 4 != 0. Assume that x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0:
    x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2 = 0. Take the square root of both
    sides, showing that x - 2 = 0, so x = 2. 2 is not greater than 3,
    so if x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0, x is not greater than 3. Q.E.D.</pre>
    </div>

    <p>That&#8217;s all for this week - I expect more proof techniques next week, but we&#8217;ll see what happens.</p>
