    <p>–</p>
    <p>[Seen through an Ultraviolet Light Filter] pushed her wings out as she jumped off of the cliff. Carefully catching the thermals off of the beach far below with an ease that revealed years of practice, she spun and swooped out over the crystal-blue ocean.</p>
    <p>[Gently Revolving Counterclockwise in Place] didn’t deign to follow the laws of physics as ze floated after her, arms crossed across zer chest. “Look, [Ultraviolet], it just doesn’t make sense.” Ze said. “No one has any idea what you’ll find if you do it. Chances are, you’ll just die in a few kiloseconds.”</p>
    <p>[Ultraviolet] spun on her axis so that she was facing [Counterclockwise] for a few moment, slipping sideways through the layers of air. “[Counterclockwise]! Don’t you get it? It’s the last possible real adventure! In only 4 gigaseconds [Objective External Time], [Alpha Mariner-4] will have evaporated, and then all the remaining black-holes will be outside my light cone.” She emoted sadness for a moment. “Don’t you remember exploring [TN J0924-2201]?”</p>
    <p>[Counterclockwise] shook zer head ruefully. “Of course I do. How could I forget? That was one of the best eras I can recall. But the universe is going to last another 1.2E997 gigaseconds [[Ultraviolet]’s subjective time at current rate: 9.3E1006 gigaseconds]. You would be missing out on literal lifetimes of fun.”</p>
    <p>[Ultraviolet] sighed. “We already know the end is coming, yes? Well I don’t want to spend the my next 10 lifetimes listening to a bunch of immortals whine about the eventual end of their immortality. There was enough doom-saying for everyone when all the protons decayed.” She flipped over, gliding away from [Counterclockwise], and further out over the ocean.</p>
    <p>“But what if we find a way to reverse entropy?” [Counterclockwise] begged, accelerating slightly to match her new pace.</p>
    <p>“Heh. The last actual scientific discovery was what, 10,000 gigaseconds ago? I’m not holding my breath. Look. I didn’t ask you here to try to change my mind. I asked you here to get you to come with me. [Unperturbed Artificial Clouds]’s group is leaving in 200 kiloseconds [Subjective], and I want to join them.”</p>
    <p>“200 kiloseconds”, [Counterclockwise] whispered. “You’ve only given me 200 kiloseconds to make up my mind.” Turning away from [Ultraviolet]’s areal acrobatics, [Counterclockwise] said “You know I can’t do that. I have too much to live for to throw it away on such a slim chance.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah.” [Ultraviolet]’s shoulders slumped. “Yeah, I knew. I just hoped . . . I just hoped I meant more to you.”</p>
    <p>“Oh [Ultraviolet],” said [Counterclockwise], tears starting to stream down zer face, “I will always love you. And I really hope that you do find something new and wonderful. I just can’t throw away all of my work and all of my friendships to go black hole diving with you.”</p>
    <p>“Then I guess this is goodbye.”</p>
    <p>“Yeah. Goodbye, [Ultraviolet].”</p>
    <p>“Goodbye, [Counterclockwise].” And with that, [Ultraviolet] snapped her wings together, executing a perfect forward dive into the ocean. As she vanished from sight, she signed the final transfer paperwork and sped off towards [Alpha Mariner-4] at the speed of light, never to be seen again.</p>
    <p>–</p>
    <p>[Counterclockwise] sometimes regretted zer actions that [afternoon] over the beach. Ze didn’t regret living, didn’t regret staying with zer family, but ze regretted not trying harder to keep [Ultraviolet] from jumping. In some ways, ze felt it was zer fault.</p>
    <p>The not knowing was probably the worst part. [Counterclockwise] never knew how long she survived. Never knew if she discovered anything magical inside the black hole. No information could ever escape a black hole, and so [Counterclockwise] could never know.</p>
    <p>Ze moved on, and made other friends, had other lovers. Ze became well-known for constructing a beautiful symphony played only with the gravitational interference from 10,000 colliding galaxies. Ze traveled the worlds, and saw beautiful sights, and lived another 7.4E998 gigaseconds [subjective].</p>
    <p>And at the end, as the very last neg-entropy of the universe trickled out of the very last reserves, to drive the very last computer, [Counterclockwise] stood under the simulated stars with zer friends and family, and watched as the stars blinked out, one by one, until only one was left. For a long, trembling moment there was silence. Then the last simulated star blinked out, and so did [Counterclockwise].</p>
