<h1>Mirror</h1>
</br>
Josephine Alice Cooper was an imaginative girl of twelve years, who lived with her loving parents in a nice house in Surry. She was reading a book that had been given to her by her grandmother, after whom she was named. The book was an old copy of Through the Looking Glass, and after she read the introduction she began eyeing the mirror over their mantelpiece suspiciously. She set her book down on the couch and dragged a stool in front of the fireplace. She carefully stuck her head through the mirror, and looked left and right. Everything seemed to be in its place. She climbed through the mirror completely, and set off to explore the house. To her disappointment, everything seemed to be the same, except switched left-for-right, as though seen in a mirror. It  was seen in a mirror, she supposed. The garden and hill outside proved to be just as boring. She was sitting on top of a fencepost, waiting for an adventure to find her, when she had a terrible thought. What if her reflection was running amok in her house? With a cry, she rushed back into the room and through the mirror. She called her mother. “Mother, have I been causing trouble?”
</br>
“No. . . What have you been doing?” her mother asked nervously.
</br>
“Um. Nothing.” Josephine replied. She glared at her book, still sitting on the couch. She picked it up and was just about to resume reading when she spun suddenly and glared at the mirror. If a girl travels through a mirror, she expects to have an adventure. She was about to turn away in a huff, when she thought she saw her reflection wink.
