The [Digital Humanities Toolkit](https://github.com/setupminimal/digital-humanities-tools) is a small set of utilities I put together to help my mother, [Sparrow F. Alden](https://wordsthatyouweresaying.wordpress.com), with her project in which she constructed a digital concordance of The Hobbit. The tools 
are available for free, and all you need to run them is [Python](https://python.org), so if you find yourself needing to write a concordance of a large body of text, your day might have just gotten a lot easier.
