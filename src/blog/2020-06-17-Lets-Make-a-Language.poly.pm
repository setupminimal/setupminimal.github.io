◊title{Let's Make a Language}

Exciting news! On July 3rd, 2021 at 11:00 AM EDT, I'm starting a new, public project.

I'm starting a Twitch stream called "Let's Make a Language". I will livestream my progress as I buld a conlang, showing you my tools, references, and getting to geek out about language.

You can find it at ◊link[#:to "https://twitch.tv/setupminimal"]{twitch.tv/setupminimal}. I can't wait to do this, and I hope that you'll come enjoy it and then let me know what you think.
