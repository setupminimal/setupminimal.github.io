= The Start of a New Term

Hello everyone! I'm back, after a long (and remarkably busy) winter break!

Here are the courses I will be taking this year:

=== CS 515 - Data Structures

I'm excited for this course. In it, we will be learning about C++, memory layout and cache optimization, and different generally-useful data structures (2-3 Trees, etc.).

This first week footnote:[Only 3 days long, because of unfortunate weather], we talked about Abstract Data Types, and how things are actually represented on computers. This is similar to things that I covered in my articles on CS 417 last year - I used a lot of ASCII-art diagrams to show people the structure of individual objects in memory.

=== CS 520 - Assembly Language

This course looks hard, but rewarding. In it, we are going to use plain C, instead of C++, and connect the gaps between our current understanding of computers at a high-level, and an Electrical Engineer's understanding of the actual circuitry and chip design.

Our first lesson laid out the Professor's expectations for the course, as well as giving a short listing of what we will be creating.

=== Introduction to Theater

The professor for this course is very ... footnote:[Observe the dramatic pause] dramatic. This course combines History, Literary Criticism, and Acting to introduce students to live theater. The professor insists that proper Theater (you can hear the capital letters when she speaks) can't be taught out of books - so I may not have much success is relaying this particular class for your reading pleasure.

=== HIST 440D - Citizens and Persons

This year UNH is hosting a series of lectures called "Who's Human Now?", a look at persecution, dehumanization, civil rights, and science through history. Several professors are collaborating to run the HIST 440 courses (sections A-D), as a way to get more in-depth perspective on citizenship and person hood from students in many majors.

I don't really know exactly what to expect, but I'm looking forward to it just the same.

=== And An Extra

I am also setting aside time - as promised on my Patreon page - to do research into statistics detailing different sections of the population during the Revolutionary War. My very generous supporters want one large summary once all of my research is finished, so I won't have weekly updates.


== A Final Note

One last thing. I am taking what are generally regarded as the two toughest non-elective undergraduate CS courses, as well as Honors history, in addition to my own research, writing, and programming footnote:[I actually just finished a helpful little web app that allows you to look up laws and bills - link:https://setupminimal.github.io/lawSearch.html[find it here.]].

So I'm going to apologies in advance for missing updates. This blog is one way that I revise and push my understanding of the subjects I study, but actual assignments, as well as my job at the UNH InterOperability Laboratory, take time.

That said, I am genuinely pleased to have so many people interested in reading about my studies, and I appreciate your support quite a lot. I look forward to telling you next week about my first programming assignments (Unicode conversion), and my reading for History (from _Inventing Human Rights_ and _No Constitutional Right to be Ladies_).
