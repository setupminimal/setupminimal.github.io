◊title{Digital Humanities Tools}

The ◊link[#:to "https://github.com/setupminimal/digital-humanities-tools"]{Digital Humanities Toolkit} is a small set of utilities I put together to help my mother, ◊link[#:to "https://wordsthatyouweresaying.wordpress.com"]{Sparrow F. Alden}, with her project in which she constructed a digital concordance of The Hobbit. The tools 
are available for free, and all you need to run them is ◊link[#:to "https://python.org"]{Python}, so if you find yourself needing to write a concordance of a large body of text, your day might have just gotten a lot easier.
