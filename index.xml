      <description>Here is a fun little art project I made this morning!
I thought to myself &amp;ldquo;Self, what if we made a little program that would try to make &amp;lsquo;watercolor-y&amp;rsquo; images by starting with a random canvas, and smudging the paint around?&amp;rdquo;
So I coded it up, and it looked cool, but not that cool:
 Then I thought &amp;ldquo;What if we made it so that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t just poking the canvas randomly, but actually trying to match another image?</description>

      <description>note is a simple little utility that lets you keep notes for a particular project on the command line.
The commands are all pretty simple - in the form of note that this is a note or note list. You can build and install note using stack.</description>

      <description>The Digital Humanities Toolkit is a small set of utilities I put together to help my mother, Sparrow F. Alden, with her project in which she constructed a digital concordance of The Hobbit. The tools are available for free, and all you need to run them is Python, so if you find yourself needing to write a concordance of a large body of text, your day might have just gotten a lot easier.</description>

      <description>I created the Foxy Society Name Generator a while ago for the HPKCHC. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun way to find out what your Secret Foxy Society Name might be.</description>

      <description>I created JuliaClock during High School for my required art credit. JuliaClock is a program that takes the current time, generates a unique Julia Set, and then simulates painting it.
If you are interested in the Source Code, you may be able to get JuliaClock to run on your computer. It relies on the Python Image Library and on TK. If you&amp;rsquo;d rather just look at pretty pictures: (and videos, at the bottom)</description>

      <description>Law Search is a tool that I made a little while ago. It is still a bit rough around the edges, but it allows you to search OpenStates.org data for bills with certain keywords. It was also the first thing that I built with Elm.</description>

      <description>Paperclip Optimizer is a fun little game that I made with Clojurescript. In it, you play an AI who&amp;rsquo;s goal is to maximize the number of paperclips in the world - the number of paperclips is essentially your score. But! Your job isn&amp;rsquo;t as simple as just producing as many paperclips as possible through manual labor - the world of Paperclip Optimizer has a full-fledged economy, that you need to exploit if you want to produce the most paperclips.</description>
